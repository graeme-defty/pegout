Pegout
======

Welcome to Pegout, a Parsing Expression Grammer (PEG)-based parser for 
parsing PEGs and generating an HTML file which allows easy, browser-based
navigation.

Pre-requisites
--------------

Pegout requires Erlang version R12B-3 (5.6.3) or later. The latest version of 
Erlang is available here:

[http://www.erlang.org/download.html](http://www.erlang.org/download.html)

You'll also need Neotoma installed, the latest version being available at 

[https://github.com/seancribbs/neotoma/](https://github.com/seancribbs/neotoma/)

plus Ruby and rake.

Compiling Pegout
----------------

To compile Pegout, type:

   rake

After compilation is complete, you'll see the test suite attempt to run but fail
because there is nothing in it ;-)

Implementation
--------------

Pegout is itself based on a PEG (derived from teh PEG developed by Sean Cribbs
in Neotoma) and generates theh HTML is a fairly simplistic manner.
